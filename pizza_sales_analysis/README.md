## üìÑ Project Description:

In this project, I performed a full **data analysis** on a real-world-like dataset (pizza orders, sales, sizes, etc.) using only **Excel formulas**, without using:
- Pivot Tables
- Power Query
- VBA/Macros
- Helper Columns

The main challenge was to **solve each analytical case with a single dynamic formula only**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Used Excel Functions:
- `INDEX`
- `MATCH`
- `COUNTIF`
- `COUNTIFS`
- `sum`
- `SUMIF`
- `MAX`
- `MIN`
- `FILTER`
- `UNIQUE`
- `ROWS`
- `weekday`
- etc.

## üìä Cases I solved:
- Calculate the total revenue from the orders table.
- Which pizza had the highest number of slices sold?
- Calculate the average number of orders per day.
- How many orders were placed on weekends (Saturday and Sunday)?
- Calculate the total revenue for each type of pizza.
- Calculate the revenue percentage for each pizza type.
- Which day had the highest total revenue?
- How many orders included only Large size pizzas?
- Calculate the average revenue per order.
- Display number of orders per hour using order time.

## üí° Notes:
- No PivotTables, Power Query, or manual steps were used.
- All solutions are done purely with **Excel formulas**.
- Focus on dynamic solutions that auto-update if data changes.
